# Hello-World
For the journy, one embarks on, its a idea, to be made into form, by the idealist, a creation, a spark in the dark, to light the way, for in the end, a spark grows, into wjat we now know. ALWAYS BE YOU, YOU DESERVE NOTHING LESS, WE DESERVE, OUR CHILDREN DESERVE, TO CREATE, as in the begining, the end is no different, to forever change from idealism creation and emotion.
